# Machina

Machina is a fun project I started to build a discord bot.
To use, pip install discord.py, and replace DISCORD_TOKEN with a valid token

Current abilities:
- Complimenting and insulting other users
- TTS capabilities
- Random emote generator
- Recognizing usernames in commands without tagging

In process:
- Daily currency system
- Database implementation to keep track of user information

Planned abilities:
- Fun vending machine
- Choose your own adventure
- Emote reactions
