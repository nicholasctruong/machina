# Machina

Machina is a fun project I started to build a discord bot. The name of my bot is Kyoko (named after one of the AI's in Ex Machina).
The motivation for building this came from the desire to add an extra layer of fun to normal conversations in discord.
To use, you can pip install discord.py, and replace DISCORD_TOKEN with a valid token

Current abilities:
- Complimenting and insulting other users

Planned abilities:
- Daily currency system
- Database implementation to keep track of user information
- Fun vending machine
- Emote reactions
